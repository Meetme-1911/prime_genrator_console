# prime_genrator_console

A basic prime generator console application written in JAVA language .
Which returns prime numbers betweeen n numbers or a specific range .

Please refrain to input numbers in range larger than 10^9.
In algorithms, I have used printing elements instead of returning a whole list of integers because , if you input a number in range of 10^7 to 10^8 It will take considerate amount of time before returning the list .

But I have maintained a list of integers and have method return type as list of integers to run unit test cases .
